// SoundManager is intended to keep samples in memory in a place where
// they can be reaccessed by filename (so that I don't have to open the
// file repeatedly or worse, load the sound multiple times). Streams
// are also "getted" through this interface, but are not stored in the
// map because a stream can only be played once at a time. (Incidentally,
// the sound/sound instance concept kind of breaks down for streams,
// because there is always just one sound to one instance for streams.)
